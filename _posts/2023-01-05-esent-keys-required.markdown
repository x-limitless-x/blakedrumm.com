## :book: Introduction
I had a case recently for a customer that is having issues when installing an SCOM Agent (***MOMAgent.msi***) with an warning which stated:
```
Microsoft ESENT Keys are required to install this application.
Please see the release notes for more information.
```

## :page_with_curl: How to fix
In order to resolve this issue for my customer, we had to run the installer as administrator. Which we accomplished by opening a Powershell window as administrator and navigating to the directory of the SCOM Agent installer (***MOMAgent.msi***).
