# Requirements
System Center Operations Manager - Management Server

Administrator Privileges

Powershell 4+ (will still run on Powershell 3)

# Instructions

Download Zip file (More Actions - Download Zip File) and extract tool to a directory (ex. C:\Data Collector)

You need to change to the directory in PowerShell to the script location, such as “cd C:\Data Collector”
 
If run on a SCOM management server (preferred) we will gather their SQL server names and DB names from the local registry.  Otherwise user will need to input names.

The script will attempt to query the SQL server remotely, and create CSV files in the local folder .\Output.

We will query both OperationsManager DB and Master DB, so having a high level of rights to SQL is preferred.

A zip file will be created in the directory where you are running the script, SDC_Results_04_04_1975.zip. This will cleanup the .\Output folder in the process.

This script has the ability to gather the following information:

 - SCOM Version Installed
 - Database Information / DB Version
 - SCOM RunAs Account Information
 - Check TLS 1.2 Readiness
 - Certificates
 - Event Logs
 - MSInfo32
 - Unsealed MP's
 - Clock Synchronization
 - Latency Check (Ping Test)
 - this list is not complete..
