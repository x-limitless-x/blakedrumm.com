  One of my customers needed the uptime report for SCOM Agents in their environment. I couldn't find any good guides so I wrote this one.

In order to properly report on the uptime of a machine, you will need to target the Health Service Watcher object class. This class will allow you to return the availability of the machine itself, and not all of the rollup monitors underneath that may affect the report accuracy.

## Dynamic Agent Health Service Watcher Group

If you would like to make it easier to run the report again, you can create a group for the Health Service Watchers. Just create a group in **Authoring** -> **Groups**, with the following Dynamic Member Rule: \
