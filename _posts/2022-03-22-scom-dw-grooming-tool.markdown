## Introduction

This tool can be used to modify the System Center Operations Manager Data Warehouse Grooming retention days, allows you to see grooming history, you can manually run grooming, and you may also export the current configuration so you can keep a backup of your settings. You have the option of reseting the values to Defaults for the typical data sets in the Data Warehouse.

## How to Use

You have multiple ways to run the SCOM DW Grooming GUI Tool:
