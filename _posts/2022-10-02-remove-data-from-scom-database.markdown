  Sometimes you need to remove data from the SCOM Database that relates to a specific server or client. If you need it done quickly, without having to open SQL Server Management Studio, or run queries manually; so I created this script in Powershell to assist.

keywords: remove scom data permanently, remove scom agent from database, purge scom agent, purge agent from scom, purge agent, purge operations manager agent

## Introduction
I have had many cases where I've had to run the following SQL Queries by Kevin Holman: [Deleting and Purging data from the SCOM Database (kevinholman.com)](https://kevinholman.com/2018/05/03/deleting-and-purging-data-from-the-scom-database/) ***(A big thank you to Kevin Holman for his guide!)***

After the 6th or 7th time running the script I decided that I could automate this process in Powershell and make it very easy to do this automatically for as many servers as you need. This script will query the Operations Manager database and run all the steps in Kevin Holman's queries. The script will ask questions at each step to verify the action is correct. You have to answer **Y** or **N** before the script will proceed.

## How to get it
You can get a copy of the script here: \

> ## :notebook: Note
> You may edit line [751](https://github.com/blakedrumm/SCOM-Scripts-and-SQL/blob/master/Powershell/Quick%20Fixes/Remove-SCOMBaseManagedEntity.ps1#L751) in the script to change what happens when the script is run without any arguments or parameters, this also allows you to change what happens when the script is run from the Powershell ISE.
