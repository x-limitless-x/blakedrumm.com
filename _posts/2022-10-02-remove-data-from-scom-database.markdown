  Sometimes you need to remove data from the SCOM Database that relates to a specific server or client. If you need it done quickly, without having to open SQL Server Management Studio, or run queries manually; you can instead use this Powershell script.

## :book: Introduction
I have had many cases where I've had to run the following SQL Queries by Kevin Holman: [Deleting and Purging data from the SCOM Database (kevinholman.com)](https://kevinholman.com/2018/05/03/deleting-and-purging-data-from-the-scom-database/) ***(A big thank you to Kevin Holman for his guide!)***

After the 6th or 7th time running the tsql queries I decided that I should automate this process in Powershell, and make it very easy to do this automatically for as many servers as needed. This script will query the Operations Manager database and run all the steps in Kevin Holman's queries. The script will ask questions at each step to verify the action is correct. You have to answer **Y** or **N** before the script will proceed.

> ### :exclamation: Important!
> It is recommended to only run the script when requested by a Microsoft Support Engineer. **This script can be dangerous if used incorrectly.** \
> &nbsp; \
> If you absolutely need to run the script, make sure you have full backups of your SCOM SQL Instances / Databases!

> ## :notebook: Note
> You may edit line [752](https://github.com/blakedrumm/SCOM-Scripts-and-SQL/blob/master/Powershell/Quick%20Fixes/Remove-SCOMBaseManagedEntity.ps1#L752) in the script to change what happens when the script is run without any arguments or parameters, this also allows you to change what happens when the script is run from the Powershell ISE.
