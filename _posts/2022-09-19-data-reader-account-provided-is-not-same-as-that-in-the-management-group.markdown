During installation of SCOM Reporting services, you may see the following error:
Data Reader account provided is not same as that in the management group.


### Reconfigured the "Data Warehouse Report Deployment Account" Profile
Set the Data Warehouse Report Deployment Account to the Class "Collection Server" and "Data Warehouse Synchronization Server"

### Reconfigured the "Data Warehouse Account" Profile
Data Warehouse Action Account to the Class "Collection Server", "Data Warehouse Synchronization Server", "Data Set" and "Operations Manager APM Data Transfer Service"

 After configuring the above, the SCOM Reporting component installed successfully with the **Data Warehouse Report Deployment Account** as expected.
