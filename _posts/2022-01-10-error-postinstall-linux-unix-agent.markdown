My customer was running Solaris 10 (SunOS 5.10), they were having issues when attempting to install the SCOM Agent (scx-1.6.8-1.solaris.10.sparc.sh). So we dug further into things to verify why the installer was failing on the __PostInstall__ step.

I asked the customer to copy the SCOM Linux / Unix Agent install files (`C:\Program Files\Microsoft System Center\Operations Manager\Server\AgentManagement\UnixAgents\DownloadedKits`) to the Solaris Machine so we can attempt a manual installation.

Extract the Solaris Installer file:
```shell
sh scx-1.6.8-1.solaris.10.sparc.sh --extract
```

We looked at the output after running the install manually:
```shell
[solaris10:root@/home/ops_monitoring/scxbundle.24766] pkgadd -d scx-1.6.8-1.solaris.10.sparc.pkg
 
The following packages are available:

                 (sparc) 1.6.8-1

```

The piece of the message above that stood out to me was this line:
```shell
/var/sadm/pkg/MSFTscx/install/postinstall: ENV=/usr/sislocal/profile: is not an identifier
```

I asked the customer to take a look at their Environmental Variables in `/etc/profile` and verify if there are any custom lines in there. We noticed there were custom lines, __we removed these lines and attempted the installation again, it succeeded!__
