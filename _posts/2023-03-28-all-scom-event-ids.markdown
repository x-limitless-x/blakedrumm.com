|474|Health Service ESE Store|Operations Manager|474|%1 (%2) %3The database page read from the file "%4" at offset %5 (database page %10) for %6 bytes failed verification due to a page checksum mismatch.  The expected checksum was %8 and the actual checksum was %9.  The read operation will fail with error %7.  If this condition persists then please restore the database from a previous backup.  This problem is likely due to faulty hardware. Please contact your hardware vendor for further assistance diagnosing the problem.   |
