## Introduction
The following event id prompted me to write this article.

```
Log Name:      Operations Manager
Source:        Health Service Modules
Date:          5/16/2022 2:47:00 PM
Event ID:      10103
Task Category: None
Level:         Warning
Keywords:      Classic
User:          N/A
Computer:      <ManagementServerFQDN>
Description:
In PerfDataSource, could not resolve counter instance OpsMgr DW Writer Module, Dropped Data Item Count, All Instances. Module will not be unloaded. 

One or more workflows were affected by this.  

Workflow name: Microsoft.SystemCenter.DataWarehouse.CollectionRule.Performance.Writer.DroppedDataItemCount 
Instance name: <ManagementServerFQDN> 
Instance ID: {3Z4DF6FB-B78C-33D9-BE0F-C84F7278AB92} 
Management group: <ManagementGroupName>
```

The above tells me, for some reason SCOM is no longer able to resolve some Performance Counter names on the Management Server, which causes some of the workflows for the SCOM Data Warehouse to fail.

## How to Resolve
Rebuild the Performance counters with the following Powershell Script, you can copy and paste the below script to a Powershell ISE Window running as **Administrator**:
```powershell
Push-Location $PWD
$FirstPath = 'C:\Windows\System32'
$SecondPath = 'C:\Windows\SysWOW64'
cd $FirstPath
Write-Output '---------------------------------------------------------'
Write-Output "Recreating Performance Counters in: $FirstPath"
Write-Output ' - Running: lodctr /R'
lodctr /R
cd $SecondPath
Write-Output "`nRecreating Performance Counters in: $SecondPath"
Write-Output ' - Running: lodctr /R'
lodctr /R
Write-Output '---------------------------------------------------------'
Write-Output 'Resyncing the Performance Counters with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)'
Write-Output ' - Running: C:\Windows\System32\wbem\WinMgmt.exe /RESYNCPERF'
C:\Windows\System32\wbem\WinMgmt.exe /RESYNCPERF
Write-Output '---------------------------------------------------------'
Write-Output 'Restarting Service: Performance Logs & Alerts (pla)'
$error.Clear()
try
{
	Get-Service -Name "pla" | Restart-Service -ErrorAction Stop | Out-Null
}
catch
{
	Write-Warning "A Failure has occurred: `n$error"
}
$error.Clear()
Write-Output 'Restarting Service: Windows Management Instrumentation (winmgmt)'
try
{
	Get-Service -Name "winmgmt" | Restart-Service -Force -ErrorAction Stop | Out-Null
}
catch
{
	Write-Warning "A Failure has occurred: `n$error"
}
Pop-Location
```
