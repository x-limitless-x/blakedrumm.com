## :bulb: Introduction
This is my first blog post regarding the Azure space! On my blog today, I want to shed light on a common issue customers face: tracking the usage of Cores across their licenses. This is vital for understanding how many Cores are being utilized versus what's available. Currently, Azure Portal lacks a direct report view for this, forcing customers to manually check each license and linked server to sum up the Core count, which is a hassle.

Good news, though. When a customer asks for such a report, there's a simpler method: querying the Azure Resource Graph (ARG). The query I've got does the heavy lifting. It counts the Cores from each linked Arc machine, adjusts the count to meet the minimum requirements (8 vCores per VM and 16 pCores per physical server), and then presents this data alongside the license info.

This approach is a game-changer. It not only saves time but also gives a more accurate picture of Core usage.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Steps to Gather Data

### :mag: Open Resource Graph Explorer
Within the Azure Portal open [Resource Graph Explorer](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/ArgQueryBlade).

### :memo: Kusto Query (KQL)

```kql
resources
| where type =~ "microsoft.hybridcompute/licenses"
| extend sku = tostring(properties.licenseDetails.edition),
          totalCores = toint(properties.licenseDetails.processors),
          licenseId = tostring(id)
| join kind=inner (
    resources
    | where type =~ "microsoft.hybridcompute/machines"
    | extend machineId = tostring(id),
              coreCount = toint(properties.detectedProperties.coreCount)
    | join kind=inner (
        resources
        | where type =~ "microsoft.hybridcompute/machines/licenseProfiles"
        | extend machineId = tostring(trim_end(@"\/\w+\/(\w|\.)+", id)),
                  licenseId = tostring(properties.esuProfile.assignedLicense)
    ) on machineId
    | extend coreType = case(
        coreCount >= 16, 'pCore',
        coreCount >= 8, 'vCore',
        'Unknown'
    )
    | extend validCoreCount = case(
        (coreType =~ 'pCore' and coreCount >= 16) or
        (coreType =~ 'vCore' and coreCount >= 8), coreCount,
        0 // Exclude cores that don't meet the criteria
    )
) on licenseId
| summarize UsedCoreCount = sum(validCoreCount) by licenseId, name, type, location, subscriptionId, resourceGroup, sku, totalCores, coreType
| where UsedCoreCount > 0
```
